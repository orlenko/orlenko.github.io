## Vlad Orlenko

In 20 years of writing software, Iâ€™ve covered a lot of ground. 
[Drones](https://dronedeploy.com) and [modern web](https://styleseat.com), 
[low-level networking code](https://appneta.com) and 
[distributed systems](https://www.vaisala.com), dozens of languages, frameworks and operating systems. 

I am looking for a role where my skills and experience could bring maximum value to the table.
